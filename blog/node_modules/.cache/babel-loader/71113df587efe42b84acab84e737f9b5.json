In an online book club, it doesn't matter if your members are in the same city or halfway across the world, because thanks to the power of the internet, you can all be in one digital space at the same time.</p>\r\n                    <Container className = \"tips\">\r\n                        <Row className = \"Tip\">\r\n                            <Col>\r\n                                <h1>1</h1>\r\n                                <h3>Make a designated Facebook group for all members to join.</h3>\r\n                            </Col>\r\n                            <div className = \"postTip\">\r\n                                There are a lot of different social media platforms out there, but Facebook is among the best for organizing group activities, including an online book club. One of the first steps to starting your own group is to establish a Facebook page for it, where you can invite new members to join, share new reading suggestions, and post meeting schedules. You can make your group private, so only members you invite are allowed to join, or leave it open to the public so more readers can join in.\r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n                        <Row className = \"Tip\">\r\n                            <Col>\r\n                                <h1>2</h1>\r\n                                <h3>Utilize the tools on Goodreads.</h3>\r\n                            </Col>\r\n                            <div className = \"postTip\">\r\n                                After you have your Facebook page set up, you're going to want to head on over to Goodreads and start giving your club a more robust online presence. Like you did on Facebook, you can use this bookish social media site to establish a group that members can join. On the group landing page, you can add a description of your club, keep track of members, moderate discussions on the discussion board, list upcoming events, including online meetings, and digitally shelve all of the books your club has read. Goodreads is basically a dream come true for anyone running an online book club, so if you aren't familiar yet, it's about time.\r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n                        <Row className = \"Tip\">\r\n                            <Col>\r\n                                <h1>3</h1>\r\n                                <h3>Have a set moderator for discussions.</h3>\r\n                            </Col>\r\n                            <div className = \"postTip\">\r\n                                If you're ever sat in on a book club in person, you know that too many book-lovers can get out of control quickly — what can we say, we just really love talking about books! But if you think discussions IRL can get out of hand, just wait until you're trying to get a word in online. That's why it's essential that for all of your digital book club meetings, you have an official moderator that can get the discussion going in the beginning with pre-written questions, as well as keep the club's talk on track, organized, and fair to all participants involved. If you are running the book club, you can volunteer to be the moderator, or have other members of the club take turns at the helm.\r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n                        <Row className = \"Tip\">\r\n                            <Col>\r\n                                <h1>4</h1>\r\n                                <h3>Change up the way you hold your discussions.</h3>\r\n                            </Col>\r\n                            <div className = \"postTip\">\r\n                            Speaking of discussions, don't be afraid to change up the way your book club hosts its online meetings to include a variety of communication methods. If you like to see one another, you can use Skype video chat or Google Chats video calls. If you prefer text-based conversations, your options are basically limitless and include using your Facebook or Goodreads page to generate discussion, use an official hashtag on Twitter to host an online #bookchat, or use one of the many online chatting tools including Slack, Fleep, HipChat, and more. There is no end to the number of ways you and your group can talk about books online, so don't be afraid to explore until you find the perfect one.\r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </Row>\r\n                        <Row className = \"Tip\">\r\n                            <Col>\r\n                                <h1>5</h1>\r\n                                <h3>Make a designated Facebook group for all members to join.</h3>\r\n                            </Col>\r\n                            <div className = \"postTip\">\r\n                                There are a lot of different social media platforms out there, but Facebook is among the best for organizing group activities, including an online book club.
