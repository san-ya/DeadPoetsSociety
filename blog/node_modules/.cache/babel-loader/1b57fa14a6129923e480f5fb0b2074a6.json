Rachel Roddy traces an alternative personal history through the cookers in her life; Rebecca May Johnson considers the radical potential of finger food; Ruby Tandoh discovers other definitions of sweetness through the work of writer Doreen Fernandez; Yemisí Aríbisálà remembers a love affair in which food failed as a language; and Julia Turshen considers food’s ties to community.</div>\r\n                    <div>A collection to savour and inspire, <i>In the Kitchen</i> brings together thirteen contemporary writers whose work brilliantly explores food, capturing their reflections on their experiences in the kitchen and beyond.</div>\r\n                </Col>\r\n            </Row>\r\n            <Row>\r\n                <img src = {book3} className = \"bookImage\" />\r\n                <Col className = \"bookDesc\">\r\n                    <h3 className = \"bookTitle\">Intimations</h3>\r\n                    <div>Deeply personal and powerfully moving, a short and timely series of reflective essays by one of the most clear-sighted and essential writers of our time.
